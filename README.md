# Risk Management Expert System

The **Risk Management Expert System** is a knowledge-based system implemented in CLIPS that helps analyze and manage risks in large construction projects. It uses forward and backward reasoning to deduce risks from user inputs, detect risk factors, and issue alarms for critical risks.

##  Features

- **Forward Reasoning**: Deduce risks based on user-provided issues.
- **Backward Reasoning**: Validate hypotheses about potential risks.
- **Structured Knowledge Representation**: Categorizes issues, risk factors, and risks for better organization.
- **Dynamic User Interaction**: Prompts users for input and provides detailed results.
- **Risk Alarms**: Automatically generates alarms for critical risks.

## Code Structure

- `Templates`: Define knowledge base structures for issues, risk factors, risks, and contractual defects.
- `Rules`: Implement logic for detecting risks, deducing alarms, and reasoning.
- `User Interaction`: Handles user input and output.
- `Validation`: Ensures proper inputs and provides warnings for unknown issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [CLIPS](https://www.clipsrules.net/) on your system.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/risk-management-expert-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd risk-management-expert-system
   ```

---

##  Usage

1. Open the CLIPS environment.
2. Load the system's `.clp` file:
   ```clips
   (load "risk_management.clp")
   ```
3. Reset the environment:
   ```clips
   (reset)
   ```
4. Run the system:
   ```clips
   (run)
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to input issues and view deduced risks.

##  Example Interaction

1. **User Input:**
   ```
   Please enter an issue description (e.g, 'complicated laws', 'lack in examination of project managers'): complicated laws
   ```
2. **System Deduction:**
   ```
   Risk Factor: general-factors - Complicated or foreign legal environment
   Risk ID: r13 - Risk of approval or compliance issues due to unfamiliar legal system
   ```
3. **Risk Alarm:**
   ```
   RISK ALARM** [r13]: Risk of approval or compliance issues due to unfamiliar legal system
   ```
